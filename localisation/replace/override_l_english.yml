 # Piety/Papacy
 CONVREL_PAPACY: "The Shadow Council cannot convert to another religion."
 PIETY_DESCRIPTION: "Fanaticism represents the dedication to ones faith and the willingness to wage war in its name. The higher the fanaticism the harder your soldiers will fight for you. The lower your fanaticism, your ability to wage war decreases, but allows you to recouperate in times of peace. However, be wary of your subjects as they will not tolerate the heathens to sit idle and untouched at their borders for long."
 PATRIARCH_DESCRIPTION: "Each nation that follows the Church of the Holy Light has their own bishopric that reports to the Archbishop of Stormwind. Nations that follow the Light of the Naaru follow a similar tradition and have their high priests report to the Prophet. Church influence represents the amount of influence these priests and bishops have on your society. Low influence leads to an increase in funds directly to your nation, more interest in trade, and increased authority to your ruler. High influence attracts priests, trained paladins, and helps the local population that have fallen on hard times."
